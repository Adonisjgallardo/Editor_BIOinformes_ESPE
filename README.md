## Automatic Report Compiler-Maker (Tex-Bash) (Not named yet)
This is my first try to make a program and git it since my computer. Also, is my first time writting on English, using Bash, tex and basically existing in the World Wide Web. 

### How it works

Bashing ```Informe.sh``` will run the program. It will print information about how to elaborate a report
in APA 6 format.

You'll need to insert the Introduction, Objectives, Materials, etc and the program just put all together with TeX sintax 
and compile it. Also, include a grammar corrector and prints the pdf.

### Why I need it working

I use it for my university reports for fifth level  of the biotechnology carrer. In this level I have
seven courses (subjects, classes) and everyone request a report for a laboratory practice. 
I really need to optimize my time for learning and this is my proposal.
